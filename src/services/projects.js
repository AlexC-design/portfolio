        <p>This was a re-make of an older project I've done.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I liked the original idea of the app, but I wasn't very happy with the
          end result, as I had built the original app when I was still new to my
          journey in web development.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          So armed with new knowledge and skills I set out to re-build the
          website.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I already had a pretty good idea of what I want to make, and I was
          already familiar with the tMDB API, so I started this one out with
          some design exploration for the styling of the UI, as this was the
          main area I wanted to improve.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Once I found something that I was happy with, I started focusing on
          the structure of the website. I wanted to do something similar to the
          previous version, but improve it based on feedback I've received over
          the time from people who have used the website, and from using it
          myself.
